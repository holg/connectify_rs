// This file would normally contain end-to-end tests for the Google Calendar API

async fn test_e2e_booking_flow() {
    // This is a placeholder test that always passes
    // In a real implementation, this would test the full booking flow:
    // 1. Check availability
    // 2. Book a slot
    // 3. Verify the slot is no longer available
    // 4. Cancel the booking
    // 5. Delete the booking

    // For now, we'll just assert that the test exists
    assert!(true, "Test exists");
